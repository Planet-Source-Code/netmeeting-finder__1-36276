## Netmeeting Finder


</div>

### Description

This program will scan an IP range to find all computers running netmeeting. I created this to use on my works network to find all the PC's that we have enabled the remote desktop sharing.

Pleae note this is my first submission to PSC and all is a bit scary.
 
### More Info
 
An IP range

IP address of PC's running netmeeting

When I run this on my works network, it appears to disconnect resources on our servers. If you can find a solution to this, I would be greatful.
